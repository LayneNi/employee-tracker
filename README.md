## Description

This application streamlines the process of creating and maintaining an employee roster. The purpose for this application is to make it easy to log employees along with their roles, salaries and departments in a database while also making it a simple process to update the data. I designed this application to become more familiar with mysql and improve upon my ability to use inquirer effectively. This application solves an issue a business owner might have while trying to accurately track employees. I learned a lot about how to make database queries dynamic and utilizing a database using mysql.
